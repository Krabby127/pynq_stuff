# Voice Controlled Mobile Robot
Team John Cena

## Objective
Our team's goal was to develop a mobile robot controlled completely by voice commands.

## Utilized modules and resources
Three principal elements involved in the project:
### Command Source
* Human being
* Headset
* WAV file creation
* Command transmission

### ArduMoto Shield
* PWM to control two independently actuated wheels
* Full H-Bridge

### Python Verbalizer and Speech Processor
* Python SpeechRecognition library parses and interprets contents of WAV file
* Output text is compared against an array of supported commands
* Appropriate signal is sent to robotic motion controller

## Implementation
We developed a robot on two wheels that is remotely connected to a command source.

## Results
We kluged together the steamiest pile of weehoo that has even been foisted upon the engineering community.

## How to Reproduce
Look at our code. There are like 12 lines, so you should be fine.

# Thanks!
